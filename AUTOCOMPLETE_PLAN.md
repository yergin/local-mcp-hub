# MCP Hub Autocomplete Development Plan

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Process Management
**DO NOT USE `taskkill //F //IM node.exe`** - This kills ALL Node.js processes including Claude Code!

Instead, use port-based targeting to find the specific server:
1. Find process using the port: `netstat -ano | findstr :3002`
2. Kill specific PID: `taskkill //PID <pid> //F` (note: use // not / on Windows)
3. Or check server health: `curl -s http://localhost:3002/health`

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Basic `/v1/completions` endpoint (lines 254-293 in hub.ts)
- ✅ Continue extension config with `tabAutocompleteModel` pointing to hub
- ✅ Console logging for debugging completion requests/responses
- ⚠️ Very basic completion implementation (just prepends "Complete this code:" to prompt)

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Protocol Understanding & Testing
1. **[✅] Test current implementation** - Run the hub and try autocomplete in VS Code to see what requests/responses look like
2. **[✅] Analyze logs** - Examine the console output to understand the exact format Continue expects
3. **[✅] Research OpenAI format** - Compare completions vs chat completions API for autocomplete use cases

### Phase 2: Improve Core Functionality
4. **[✅] Enhanced prompt engineering** - Better prompts for code completion context
5. **[✅] Streaming support** - Add streaming for responsive autocomplete UX
6. **[ ] Serena integration** - Use Serena MCP for semantic code analysis in completions

## Notes
- Current endpoint location: `hub.ts:254-293`
- Continue config: `continue-config.yaml` with `tabAutocompleteModel` configured
- Hub runs on port 3002 by default
- Ollama backend configured for completions

## Progress Log
- ✅ Server running on port 3002, receiving FIM requests from Continue
- ✅ Added hard-coded suggestions for testing (fibonacci function, FIM format)
- ✅ Added streaming support for autocomplete
- ✅ Server restarted with new autocomplete logic
- ✅ **CONFIRMED: Dummy suggestions working in VS Code!**

### Phase 1 Complete ✅
Basic autocomplete protocol is working. Ready for Phase 2.
