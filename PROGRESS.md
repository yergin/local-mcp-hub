# Local MCP Hub - Agent Mode Progress Summary

## Current Status: Tool Selection Working, Integration Issue Identified

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Agent Mode Enablement**
   - Successfully enabled VS Code Continue agent mode by adding `capabilities: [tool_use]` and `supportsToolUse: true`
   - Modified hub's `/v1/models` endpoint to declare tool calling capabilities
   - Continue now shows "Agent (Supported)" instead of "Agent (Not Supported)"

2. **MCP Protocol Implementation**
   - Implemented proper MCP handshake: initialize ‚Üí notifications/initialized ‚Üí wait for language server ‚Üí tools/list
   - Fixed timing issues with Serena language server initialization (25+ second wait required)
   - Successfully established communication with both Serena (27 tools) and Context7 (2 tools) MCP servers

3. **Enhanced Tool Selection Architecture**
   - Created maintainable tool enhancement system with usage guidance
   - Implemented `enhanceToolWithUsageGuidance()` and `getToolUsageGuidance()` methods
   - Added specific "USE WHEN" criteria for each tool:
     ```
     'list_dir': 'USE WHEN: user asks "what files are in", "list files", "show directory contents", "what\'s in this folder"'
     'find_file': 'USE WHEN: user wants to find specific files by name or pattern'
     'read_file_content': 'USE WHEN: user wants to see the contents of a specific file'
     // ... etc for all 29 tools
     ```

4. **Validation and Testing**
   - Created standalone test app (`tools/test-tool-selection.js`) that validates tool selection logic
   - Extracted real MCP schemas to `tools/serena-schemas.json`
   - **CONFIRMED**: Tool selection prompt works correctly - LLM properly selects `list_dir` tool for "What files are in this directory?"

### üîç Current Issue: Integration Problem

**Problem**: While standalone testing shows tool selection works perfectly, Continue agent mode returns `{"tool": null}` for the same request.

**Evidence from logs**:
```
info: Tools received from Continue: 1 tools found
debug: Continue tools: {"0":"dummy_tool"}
info: Using MCP tools instead: 29 tools
debug: MCP tools: {"0":"list_dir","1":"find_file",...}
info: Tool selection response: {"tool": null}
```

**Root Cause**: Unknown - tool selection logic is proven to work in isolation but fails in the hub integration.

### üéØ Next Steps (for next session)

1. **Debug Integration Issue**
   - Add detailed logging to see the exact prompt being sent to LLM in hub context
   - Compare hub prompt format with working standalone test
   - Check if tool descriptions are being properly enhanced in the hub pipeline
   - Verify LLM response parsing in hub vs standalone

2. **Potential Investigation Areas**
   - Tool description formatting differences between hub and test
   - Request context or message format affecting LLM behavior
   - Temperature/parameters differences between hub and test calls
   - Character limits or prompt truncation in hub context

### üìÅ Key Files

- `/home/gino/Yergin/local-mcp-hub/src/hub.ts` - Main hub implementation with tool selection logic
- `/home/gino/Yergin/local-mcp-hub/tools/test-tool-selection.js` - Working standalone test
- `/home/gino/Yergin/local-mcp-hub/tools/serena-schemas.json` - Extracted MCP schemas
- `/home/gino/Yergin/local-mcp-hub/continue-config.yaml` - Continue extension configuration

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

**Hub Flow**:
1. Continue sends request with tools ‚Üí Hub receives
2. Hub replaces Continue's tools with 29 enhanced MCP tools
3. Hub calls `selectToolWithLLM()` with enhanced tool descriptions
4. LLM should select appropriate tool based on "USE WHEN" criteria
5. Hub auto-executes safe tools and returns complete response

**Current State**: Steps 1-3 working, Step 4 failing (returns null), Step 5 never reached.

### üß™ Test Results

**Standalone Test**: ‚úÖ WORKING
```bash
$ node tools/test-tool-selection.js
=== Testing: "What files are in this directory?" ===
LLM Response: {"tool": "list_dir", "args": {"relative_path": ".", "recursive": false}}
‚úÖ Parsed successfully: { tool: 'list_dir', args: { relative_path: '.', recursive: false } }
üéØ Selected tool: list_dir
```

**Hub Integration**: ‚ùå FAILING
```
Tool selection response: {"tool": null}
```

### üîß Technical Details

- **MCP Servers**: Serena (27 tools) + Context7 (2 tools) = 29 total tools
- **LLM**: qwen2.5:latest on remote Ollama server (10.0.0.24:11434)
- **Agent Mode**: Successfully enabled in Continue
- **Tool Selection**: Enhanced with usage guidance, validated working in isolation
- **Auto-execution**: Implemented for safe read-only tools

The architecture is sound and the tool selection logic is proven to work. The issue is specifically in the integration between the hub and Continue agent mode.
