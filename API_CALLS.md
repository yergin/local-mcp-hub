# API Calls Analysis - Test Run

This document analyzes the actual API calls and flow recorded in `.tmp/local-mcp-hub.log` during a test run with the Continue extension. The test involved a user request to "Analyze the architecture of this codebase" and demonstrates the implementation of the multi-step planning system described in PLAN.md.

## Initial Request from Continue Extension

**Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:14

### HTTP Request to Hub
- **Method**: POST `/v1/chat/completions`
- **Source**: Continue extension via OpenAI/JS 4.76.0
- **Authorization**: Bearer dummy-key
- **Content**: 653 bytes

### Request Body
```json
{
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "<important_rules>\n  You are in agent mode.\n\n  Always include the language and file name in the info string when you write code blocks.\n  If you are editing \"src/main.py\" for example, your code block should start with '```python src/main.py'\n\n</important_rules>",
      "role": "system"
    },
    {
      "content": "Analyze the architecture of this codebase. I want to understand how the different modules interact, what the main data flows are, and how requests are processed from start to finish.",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ],
  "model": "qwen2.5:latest",
  "stream": true
}
```

**Decision Point**: Hub recognizes this as a new chat completion request, not a tool call response.

## Tool Selection Phase

### Step 1: MCP Tools Initialization
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:14
- **Action**: Hub retrieves 29 available MCP tools from Serena and Context7
- **Duration**: 4ms
- **Tools Available**: list_dir, find_file, replace_regex, search_for_pattern, get_symbols_overview, find_symbol, etc.

**Decision Point**: Hub determines MCP tools are initialized and proceeds with tool selection.

### Step 2: Tool Selection via Fast Model
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:14
- **Model Used**: qwen2.5:0.5b (fast model)
- **Filtered Tools**: 12 read-only tools from 29 total tools

#### Ollama Request for Tool Selection
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:0.5b",
  "options": {
    "num_predict": 100,
    "temperature": 0.1
  },
  "prompt": "INFORMATION GATHERING PHASE\n\nUser request: \"Analyze the architecture of this codebase...\"\n\nAvailable information-gathering tools:\n- list_dir: Lists all non-gitignored files...\n- find_file: Finds non-gitignored files...\n...\n\nSelect the BEST tool to gather relevant information for this request.\n\nRespond: {\"tool\": \"name\"} or {\"tool\": null}",
  "stream": false
}
```

#### Ollama Response
```json
{
  "response": "{\"tool\": \"find_file\"}"
}
```

**Duration**: 4.788s

**Decision Point**: Fast model selected `find_file` as the most appropriate tool for this request.

### Step 3: Argument Generation via Fast Model
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:19
- **Tool**: find_file (classified as simple argument generation)

#### Ollama Request for Arguments
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:0.5b",
  "options": {
    "temperature": 0.1
  },
  "prompt": "Generate tool arguments from user request.\n\nTool: find_file\nUser request: \"Analyze the architecture of this codebase...\"\n\nParameters:\n- file_mask (string): The filename or file mask...\n- relative_path (string): The relative path...\n\nRespond ONLY with JSON: {\"args\": {\"param\": \"value\"}}"
}
```

#### Ollama Response
```json
{
  "response": "{\"args\": {\"file_mask\": \".*\", \"relative_path\": \".\"}}"
}
```

**Duration**: 1.750s

**Decision Point**: Arguments generated successfully, tool is classified as "safe" so it will be auto-executed.

## Tool Execution Phase

### Step 4: MCP Tool Call to Serena
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:21
- **Tool**: find_file
- **MCP Server**: serena

#### JSON-RPC Request to Serena
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1753223721245,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "find_file",
    "arguments": {
      "file_mask": ".*",
      "relative_path": "."
    }
  }
}
```

#### JSON-RPC Response from Serena
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1753223721245,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "{\"files\": [\".prettierignore\", \".prettierrc\", \".gitignore\"]}"
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "result": "{\"files\": [\".prettierignore\", \".prettierrc\", \".gitignore\"]}"
    },
    "isError": false
  }
}
```

**Duration**: ~50ms

**Decision Point**: Tool executed successfully, now the hub needs to decide whether to generate a final response or create a plan.

## Plan Decision Phase

### Step 5: Plan Decision via Full Model
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:21
- **Model Used**: qwen2.5:latest (full model)

The hub creates messages with the tool result and sends to the full model to determine if more tools are needed:

#### Messages Sent to Full Model (Structured Format)
```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "<important_rules>\n  You are in agent mode.\n\n  Always include the language and file name in the info string when you write code blocks.\n  If you are editing \"src/main.py\" for example, your code block should start with '```python src/main.py'\n\n</important_rules>"
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Analyze the architecture of this codebase. I want to understand how the different modules interact, what the main data flows are, and how requests are processed from start to finish."
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "I'll use the find_file tool to help answer your question."
  },
  {
    "role": "tool",
    "content": "{\"files\": [\".prettierignore\", \".prettierrc\", \".gitignore\"]}",
    "name": "find_file"
  }
]
```

#### Actual Ollama HTTP Request
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:latest",
  "options": {
    "num_predict": 4000,
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "prompt": "system: You are an AI assistant. You are a skilled developer with deep knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, and development best practices. If including code snippets, always start code blocks with the programming language and file name (e.g., ```{language} path/to/file).\n\nuser: Analyze the architecture of this codebase.

  "stream": false
}

#### Full Model Response
The model recognizes that the initial tool result is insufficient and creates a plan:

```json
{
  "main_objective": "Analyze the architecture of the codebase to understand how different modules interact, data flows, and request processing.",
  "next_step": {
    "purpose": "Identify the main entry points for requests in the application.",
    "tool": "find_file",
    "prompt": "Find all files containing 'app', 'main', or 'server' in their name or content."
  },
  "future_steps": [
    "Explore the identified entry points to understand how they handle incoming requests and interact with other modules.",
    "Analyze key data flows by tracing calls and dependencies between different parts of the codebase."
  ]
}
```

**Duration**: ~32s for plan generation

**Decision Point**: Hub detects this is a plan response and enters multi-step execution mode.

## Plan Execution Phase

### Step 6: Plan Streaming to Continue
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:53
- **Action**: Hub begins streaming the plan to Continue extension using Server-Sent Events

```
A plan has been created where the objective is: Analyze the architecture of the codebase...

- Explore the identified entry points...
- Analyze key data flows...

Identify the main entry points for requests in the application.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Decision Point**: Plan is being executed iteratively. Hub begins 10-iteration loop.

## Detailed Plan Execution - First Two Iterations

### Iteration 1: Execute Initial Plan Step
**Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:53

#### Step 1A: Argument Generation for Plan Step
**Current Plan Step**:
- **Purpose**: "Identify the main entry points for requests in the application."
- **Tool**: "find_file"
- **Prompt**: "Find all files containing 'app', 'main', or 'server' in their name or content."

**Decision Point**: Hub uses fast model for argument generation since find_file is in the fastModelTools list.

#### Ollama Request for Plan Step Arguments
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:0.5b",
  "options": {
    "temperature": 0.1
  },
  "prompt": "Generate tool arguments from user request.\n\nTool: find_file\nUser request: \"Find all files containing 'app', 'main', or 'server' in their name or content.\"\n\nParameters:\n- file_mask (string): The filename or file mask...\n- relative_path (string): The relative path...\n\nRespond ONLY with JSON: {\"args\": {\"param\": \"value\"}}"
}
```

#### Fast Model Response
```json
{
  "response": "{\"args\": {\"file_mask\": \"*\", \"relative_path\": \".\"}}"
}
```

#### Step 1B: MCP Tool Execution
**Tool Call to Serena**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1753223753729,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {

    "arguments": {
      "file_mask": "*",
      "relative_path": "."
    }

      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "result": "{\"files\": [\"config.json\", \"install.sh\", \"OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md\", \"restart-hub.sh\", \"tsconfig.json\", \"LICENSE\", \"src/request-processor.ts\", \"src/ollama-client.ts\", \"src/hub.ts\", \"src/mcp-manager.ts\", \"src/tool-selector.ts\", \"TIMING_ANALYSIS.md\", \"package-lock.json\", \".prettierignore\", \".prettierrc\", \"README.md\", \"continue-config.yaml\", \"PLAN.md\", \"install-mac.sh\", \".continue/mcpServers/new-mcp-server.yaml\", \".continue/rules/new-rule.md\", \"API_CALL_FLOW.md\", \"package.json\", \"install.bat\", \".gitignore\", \"prompts.json\", \".serena/project.yml\"]}"
    },
    "isError": false
  }
}
```

**Result Size**: 1,295 bytes

#### Step 1C: Plan Iteration via Full Model
**Time**: 2025-07-23 00:35:53

**Ollama Request for Next Plan Iteration**:
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:latest",
  "options": {
    "num_predict": 4000,
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "prompt": "Plan Objective: Analyze the architecture of the codebase to understand how different modules interact, data flows, and request processing.\n\nCompleted Steps:\n1. Identify the main entry points for requests in the application.\n\nCurrent Tool Result:\n{\"files\": [\"config.json\", \"install.sh\", \"OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md\", \"restart-hub.sh\", \"tsconfig.json\", \"LICENSE\", \"src/request-processor.ts\", \"src/ollama-client.ts\", \"src/hub.ts\", \"src/mcp-manager.ts\", \"src/tool-selector.ts\", \"TIMING_ANALYSIS.md\", \"package-lock.json\", \".prettierignore\", \".prettierrc\", \"README.md\", \"continue-config.yaml\", \"PLAN.md\", \"install-mac.sh\", \".continue/mcpServers/new-mcp-server.yaml\", \".continue/rules/new-rule.md\", \"API_CALL_FLOW.md\", \"package.json\", \"install.bat\", \".gitignore\", \"prompts.json\", \".serena/project.yml\"]}\n\nBased on the results above, decide your next action:\n\n1. If you have enough information to complete the objective, provide your final conclusion.\n\n2. If you need to continue with more tools, update your plan in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"main_objective\": \"{objective}\",\n  \"current_step_conclusion\": \"What you learned from this step\",\n  \"next_step\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"What the next step will accomplish\",\n    \"tool\": \"tool_name\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Clear instruction for the tool\"\n  },\n  \"future_steps\": [\n    \"Remaining step descriptions\"\n  ]\n}\n\nChoose the option that best serves completing the objective.",
  "stream": false
}
```

**Full Model Response** (Duration: ~33s):
```json
{
  "response": "Based on the provided list of files, it appears we need to gather more information before reaching a conclusion about the architecture and interactions within the codebase. The current file list does not directly indicate the main entry points for requests or provide clear insights into how different modules interact with each other.\n\nGiven this, let's update our plan:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"main_objective\": \"Analyze the architecture of the codebase to understand how different modules interact, data flows, and request processing.\",\n  \"current_step_conclusion\": \"The current file list does not provide enough information about main entry points or detailed interactions between modules. Additional investigation is required.\",\n  \"next_step\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"Identify the main entry points for requests in the application.\",\n    \"tool\": \"Code inspection and search\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Search for main entry point files, such as 'app.ts', 'main.ts', or any file that handles initial request processing. Look for imports and exports of key modules.\"\n  },\n  \"future_steps\": [\n    \"Analyze the identified entry points to understand data flow and module interactions.\",\n    \"Identify and analyze key modules (e.g., `src/ollama-client.ts`, `src/hub.ts`) to understand their roles in request processing and data handling.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNext, we will search for the main entry point files in the codebase as instructed. This step should help us identify where requests are initially processed and how they flow through different modules."
}
```

**Decision Point**: Hub extracts the plan from the response and prepares for iteration 2.

### Iteration 2: Execute Updated Plan
**Time**: 2025-07-23 00:36:26

#### Step 2A: Tool Execution Attempt
**Current Plan Step**:
- **Purpose**: "Identify the main entry points for requests in the application."
- **Tool**: "Code inspection and search" (Invalid tool name)
- **Prompt**: "Search for main entry point files, such as 'app.ts', 'main.ts', or any file that handles initial request processing. Look for imports and exports of key modules."

**Decision Point**: Hub attempts to find this tool but it doesn't exist in the available MCP tools.

#### Step 2B: Tool Error and State Update
The hub logs an error:
```
Error: Tool "Code inspection and search" is not available. Available tools: list_dir, find_file, replace_regex, search_for_pattern, restart_language_server, get_symbols_overview, find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, replace_symbol_body, insert_after_symbol, insert_before_symbol, write_memory, read_memory, list_memories, delete_memory, activate_project, remove_project, switch_modes, get_current_config, check_onboarding_performed, onboarding, think_about_collected_information, think_about_task_adherence, think_about_whether_you_are_done, summarize_changes, prepare_for_new_conversation, initial_instructions, resolve-library-id, get-library-docs
```

#### Step 2C: Plan Iteration with Error Result
**Ollama Request for Next Plan Iteration**:
```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5:latest",
  "options": {
    "num_predict": 4000,
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "prompt": "Plan Objective: Analyze the architecture of the codebase to understand how different modules interact, data flows, and request processing.\n\nCompleted Steps:\n1. Identify the main entry points for requests in the application.\n2. Identify the main entry points for requests in the application.\n\nCurrent Tool Result:\nError: Tool \"Code inspection and search\" is not available. Available tools: list_dir, find_file, replace_regex, search_for_pattern, restart_language_server, get_symbols_overview, find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, replace_symbol_body, insert_after_symbol, insert_before_symbol, write_memory, read_memory, list_memories, delete_memory, activate_project, remove_project, switch_modes, get_current_config, check_onboarding_performed, onboarding, think_about_collected_information, think_about_task_adherence, think_about_whether_you_are_done, summarize_changes, prepare_for_new_conversation, initial_instructions, resolve-library-id, get-library-docs\n\nBased on the results above, decide your next action:\n\n1. If you have enough information to complete the objective, provide your final conclusion.\n\n2. If you need to continue with more tools, update your plan in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"main_objective\": \"{objective}\",\n  \"current_step_conclusion\": \"What you learned from this step\",\n  \"next_step\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"What the next step will accomplish\",\n    \"tool\": \"tool_name\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Clear instruction for the tool\"\n  },\n  \"future_steps\": [\n    \"Remaining step descriptions\"\n  ]\n}\n\nChoose the option that best serves completing the objective.",
  "stream": false
}
```

**Full Model Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "Given the current tools available, it seems we can proceed by gathering more information about the codebase structure and flow using the tools provided. Here's an updated plan:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"main_objective\": \"Analyze the architecture of the codebase to understand how different modules interact, data flows, and request processing.\",\n  \"current_step_conclusion\": \"Identified the main entry points for requests in the application but cannot perform a detailed analysis due to tool limitations.\",\n  \"next_step\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"Gather information on the structure of the codebase and identify major modules and their interdependencies.\",\n    \"tool\": \"get_symbols_overview\",\n    \"prompt\": \"Provide an overview of the symbols (functions, classes, etc.) in the project to understand its structure.\"\n  },\n  \"future_steps\": [\n    \"Analyze the identified entry points to understand data flow and module interactions.\",\n    \"Identify and analyze key modules (e.g. `src/ollama-client.ts`, `src/hub.ts`) to understand their roles in request processing and data handling.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
}
```

**Decision Point**: Hub successfully adapts to the error by selecting a valid tool (get_symbols_overview) for the next iteration.

### Continuing Pattern
The hub continues this pattern for 8 more iterations, each time:
1. Attempting to execute the planned tool
2. Getting results (successful or error)
3. Sending results to full model for next plan iteration
4. Streaming step completion to Continue
5. Repeating until max iterations (10) reached

## Final Response Phase

### Step 17: Plan Completion
- **Time**: 2025-07-23 00:43:11
- **Action**: Hub streams final conclusion due to iteration limit

#### Final Message Streamed to Continue
```
Final conclusion reached
=========================

Plan execution stopped due to iteration limit. The objective may not have been fully completed.
```

#### Final Server-Sent Event
```
data: [DONE]
```

**Total Duration**: 476.429s (~8 minutes)

## Analysis and Insights

### Software Decision Points

1. **Tool Safety Classification**: The hub correctly identified `find_file` as a "safe" tool that could be auto-executed without user permission.

2. **Model Selection Strategy**: 
   - Fast model (qwen2.5:0.5b) used for tool selection and simple argument generation
   - Full model (qwen2.5:latest) used for plan generation and complex reasoning

3. **Plan Detection Logic**: The hub successfully parsed JSON plan structures embedded in natural language responses from the LLM.

4. **Error Handling**: When the LLM requested non-existent tools, the system gracefully handled errors and continued execution rather than failing.

5. **Iteration Limits**: The 10-iteration safety limit prevented infinite loops when the LLM couldn't complete the objective with available tools.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Tool Selection**: ~6.5s (4.8s + 1.7s for selection and argument generation)
- **MCP Tool Calls**: ~50ms each (very fast)
- **Plan Generation**: 32s+ (significant time spent in full model reasoning)
- **Total Execution**: ~8 minutes (mostly due to 10 iterations of planning)

### Key Observations from Detailed Analysis

1. **Fast Model Effectiveness**: The fast model (qwen2.5:0.5b) was very effective for tool selection and simple argument generation, providing sub-2s responses.

2. **Plan Adaptation**: When tools failed, the full model successfully adapted plans to use available tools, showing good error recovery.

3. **Argument Generation Issues**: The fast model sometimes generated suboptimal arguments (e.g., using ".*" instead of more specific patterns), but this didn't break the system.

4. **Invalid Tool Requests**: The LLM frequently requested tools that don't exist ("Code inspection and search", "Code Analysis Tool"), suggesting the tool guidance could be improved.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Tool Mapping**: The LLM frequently requested tools that don't exist, suggesting better tool guidance is needed.
2. **Plan Efficiency**: The multi-step planning created unnecessarily complex plans for this task.
3. **Iteration Control**: The system could benefit from better heuristics to detect when a plan is not making progress.
4. **Tool Result Processing**: Some tools returned minimal data that wasn't useful for the objective.

This analysis demonstrates the system is working as designed according to PLAN.md, successfully implementing multi-step reasoning with MCP tool integration, though with room for optimization in planning efficiency and tool utilization.

# Notes:

## Fast model initially chose bad arguments

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1753223721245,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "find_file",
    "arguments": {
      "file_mask": ".*",
      "relative_path": "."
    }
  }
}
```

This is will be a recurring problem if not fixed.

### Actions: ###

1. Include top-level non-gitignored files as part of the initial prompts using `list_dir`.
2. Change the tool selection error to be "... does not exists" rather than "... is not available".

## Initial message sent to full model

This should not include Continue's system prompt as the hub is acting as the agent and it the one generating the prompts and context.

The full model may not realise that the tool results may not be right due to bad arguments. I think it's important to include the prompt and arguments here.

The prompt is a bit confusing regarding "future_steps": first in the list is "Next step description" which is wrong. it's supposed to start with the step after the "next step". Perhaps the key should be called "later_steps" rather than "future_steps".

### Actions: ###

1. Put tool args, prompt and results in the assistant role block (The same `{tool, prompt, args, results} Assistant Tool Result Type` structure will be useful for reporting later assistant calls too):

  ```
  [
    ...
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": {
        "tool": "...",
        "prompt": "...",
        "args": "...",
        "results": ..."
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

2. Rename the "toolResultsNonStreaming" prompt variable to "planDecision".
3. Rename "future_steps" to "later_steps" and fix the prompt example.
4. Replace current_step_conclusion from the initial prompt to conclusion_from_assistant_data and assistant_data_was_helpful (true/false).

### Ollama Request for Next Plan Iteration

The prompt says "completed steps" and lists "Identify the main entry points for requests in the application". Even though the iteration completed, the objective of the step was not yet reached. I think there is a subtle confusion between "step" and "iteration". I think the prompt should tell the model what the current step is and ask the model to flag the current step as complete or not in each iteration. If the model flags it as complete, we include add it to an internal list of completed steps and provide this list in the next iteration prompt, along with its conclusion and all tool results.

There are actually 3 branching possibilities at this point:

1. The model decided to conclude the chat -> its response doesn't include a plan iteration JSON block.

2. The model has not yet completed the current step and needs to run more tools -> it returns notes to its future self, tool and prompt details in the JSON:

  ```
  {
    ...
    "current_step": {
      "notes_to_future_self": "...",
      "tool": "...",
      "prompt": "..."
    },
    ...
    /* it's free to redefine these at any point but is completely optional */
    "later_steps": [
      "...",
      "..."
    ]
  }
  ```

3. The model has completed the current step either successfully or unsuccessfully -> it returns he follow in the JSON:

  ```
  {
    ...
    "current_step": {
      "completed": true,
      "success": false,
      "notes_to_future_self": "..."
    },
    "next_step": {
      "objective": "...",
      "tool": "...",
      "prompt": "..."
    }

    /* it's free to redefine these at any point but is completely optional */
    "later_steps": [
      "...",
      "..."
    ]
    ...
  }
  ```

Now, the model's prompt request in each iteration needs to include the above info for previous steps, its current step and its later steps:

  ```
  {
    "user_prompt": "..."
    "main_objective": "..."
    "completed_steps": [
      {
        "objective": "assistant to help gather initial information",
        "success": false,  /* assistant_data_was helpful */
        "conclusion": "..." /* conclusion_from_assistant_data */
      }
      ...
      {
        "objective": "..."
        "success": false,
        "conclusion": "..."
      }
    ],
    "current_step": {
      "objective": "..."
      "completed": false,
      "notes": "...", /* notes_to_future_self */
      "assistant": {
        "tool": "...",
        "prompt": "...",
        "args": "..."
        "results": ..."
      }
    },
    "next_steps": [
      "...",
      "..."
    ]
  }
  ```

Note that tools results are not stored for completed_steps, it is up to the model to leave sufficient detail in its "notes_to_future_self" to be able to make use of this data in future iterations. The prompt will need to make this clear.

The prompt also needs to make it clear that the model decide to complete the chat, iterate on the current step or go to the next step.

### Actions: ###

1. Declare the various JSON structures as types for use in functions:

  ```
  Current Step Iteration Response Type:
  {
    "notes_to_future_self": "...",
    "tool": "...",
    "prompt": "..."
  },

  Current Step Complete Response Type:
  {
    "completed": true,
    "success": false,
    "notes_to_future_self": "..."
  },

  Next Step Response Type (note that this is also used in the initial planning response):
  {
    "objective": "...",
    "tool": "...",
    "prompt": "..."
  }

  Completed Step Request Type
  {
    "objective": "..."
    "success": false,
    "conclusion": "..."
  }

  Current Step Request Type
  {
    "objective": "..."
    "completed": false,
    "notes": "...", /* notes_to_future_self */
    "assistant": {
      /* Assistant Tool Result Type */
    },
  }
  ```

2. Implement these types as well as the complete_steps array to keep as part of the state and review the prompts.

## Final conclusion due to iteration limit

The model was not given an opportunity to provide a final conclusion on the last iteration.

### Actions: ###

1. Create a prompt for the final iteration which provides the same information as previous iterations except that it does not mention "later_steps" and is asked to provide a final conclusion.
